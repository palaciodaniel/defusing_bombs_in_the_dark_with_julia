# Defusing Bombs in the Dark with Julia

This is a mini-game that I wrote during a single night in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), a language that I find very promising for Data Science. As I expressed on the repository's description, it was part of a personal challenge: compared with my Python learning curve, where I first learned all the theory and then I started to write code, this was a completely different approach, because as of the moment of writing this text I did not take any course about Julia at all, so I installed the language on my Jupyter Notebook and wrote the code only by consulting the language's documentation and articles across the web, and for that reason it was an opportunity not only to push my resourcefulness and problem-solving skills further, but also to check how my "programming instinct" would extrapolate beyond Python.

Honestly, after this experience I will start paying much more attention to Julia, and specifically to [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/)...

To execute the game, just press the **Launch Binder** icon above, wait until the Jupyter Notebook loads (it can take a couple of minutes!) and then select the Cell where all the code is and press **Shift + Enter** every time you want to play.
